## 🛠️ Installation

1. Create a conda environment and install PyTorch:

```bash
conda create -n physhsi python=3.8
conda activate physhsi
pip3 install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

2. Install Isaac Gym:
- Download and install Isaac Gym Preview 4 from [NVIDIA Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym).
- Navigate to its Python folder and install.
  ```bash
  cd isaacgym/python && pip install -e .
  ```

3. Clone this repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/InternRobotics/PhysHSI.git
cd PhysHSI
```

4. Install PhysHSI.
```bash
cd rsl_rl && pip install -e .
cd ../legged_gym && pip install -e .
```

5. Install additional dependencies.
```bash
cd .. && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🕹️ Run PhysHSI

PhysHSI supports six tasks for the Unitree G1 humanoid robot: **CarryBox, SitDown, LieDown, StandUp, StyleLoco-Dinosaur,** and **StyleLoco-Highknee**.

### Motion Visualization

Reference motion data for each task can be found in the [motion data folder](legged_gym/resources/dataset/). To visualize reference motion data, run:

```bash
cd legged_gym
python legged_gym/scripts/play.py --task [task_name] --play_dataset
```

Here, `[task_name]` can be one of `[carrybox, liedown, sitdown, standup, styleloco_dinosaur, styleloco_highknee]`.

### Play with Pre-trained Checkpoints

Pre-trained checkpoints for each task are available in the [checkpoint folder](legged_gym/resources/ckpt/). To play a task using a checkpoint, run:

```bash
python legged_gym/scripts/play.py --task [task_name] --resume_path resources/ckpt/[task_name].pt
```

For example, to play the CarryBox task:
```bash
python legged_gym/scripts/play.py --task carrybox --resume_path resources/ckpt/carrybox.pt
```

> ⚠️ Note:
> 
> During the first 1–2 episodes of `play.py`, you may observe slight interpenetration between the robot, the object, or the platform.
> 
> This issue only occurs in the initial episodes and does not affect training or subsequent performance.

## 🤖 Train PhysHSI

### CarryBox

CarryBox is a challenging long-horizon task. We train it in two steps:

1. **Initial training:** Use a relatively small AMP coefficient and relaxed termination conditions for easier learning. Run approximately 20k steps:
    ```bash
    python legged_gym/scripts/train.py --task carrybox --headless 
    ```

2. **Refined training**: To better align with the data, manually increase the AMP coefficient and continue training for about 30~40k steps:
    ```bash
    python legged_gym/scripts/train.py --task carrybox_resume --resume --resume_path [ckpt_path] --headless
    ```
    Here, `[ckpt_path]` refers to the checkpoint from the first 20k-step training stage.

To play the final trained checkpoint:
```bash
python legged_gym/scripts/play.py --task carrybox --resume_path [ckpt_path]
```

### Other Tasks

For the remaining five tasks, you can directly train them using:
```bash
python legged_gym/scripts/train.py --task [task_name] --headless
```
Here, `[task_name]` can be one of `[liedown, sitdown, standup, styleloco_dinosaur, styleloco_highknee]`.

To play the final trained checkpoint for any task:
```bash
python legged_gym/scripts/play.py --task [task_name] --resume_path [ckpt_path]
```

> By default, PhysHSI uses **TensorBoard** for logging training metrics.  
> 
> If you prefer to use **Weights & Biases (wandb)**, please enable it in the corresponding `[task_name]_config.py` file and set the appropriate `wandb_entity` for your account.
